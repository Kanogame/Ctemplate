This is my personal C project template.
# How
This templates uses Nix dev shell for managing programs, meson build system for compilation, inludes wrap for my [personal C library](https://github.com/kanogame/klib) and some python scripts to ease out some of usual C frustrations
# Tools
Everything except editor is included in flake.nix
For vscode: meson + ccls + settings in .vscode
